## Intro

Lets automate the build of a flutter android app using [Github Actions](https://github.com/actions).
By using github actions, you can save your time and resources from builds done locally.

## Steps

First create a new repository on github and upload your flutter project to your github account.

If you prefer to understand the worflow, follow along.
If you are a copy/paste person, fire away to this [github gist link](https://gist.github.com/umarwaseeem/f8cd3762550e6dfd4f7aeb7057b9e643).

If you dont know how to do that, just press the + button on top right of github homepage, create the repository and the upload your files.

### Create the workflow file

Now, create a folder `.github/workflows` in root of your project.

Create a file named `build.yml` in that folder.
Github action will automatically pick up the configurations we will setup in a while.

### Configure the workflow

Lets define the name of the github actions workflow.
(be mindful of the tabs and spaces, those matter in a .yml or yaml file)

```
name: Flutter Android Build
```

#### Workflows Events

Now, lets set the events that will trigger the workflow.
workflow_dispatch gives you a button to trigger the workflow on your will with a button.

```
on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main
  workflow_dispatch: # trigger on a button click
```

#### Define the Workflow Job

In GitHub Actions, jobs are used to define the tasks that need to be executed. For our workflow, we are naming the job `flutter-android-build`. This job will run on the latest version of Ubuntu provided by GitHub Actions.

```
jobs:
  flutter-android-build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
```

#### Checkout the repository

The first step in our job is to checkout the repository. This allows GitHub Actions to access the code in your repository.

```
    steps:
        - name: Checkout Repository
        uses: actions/checkout@v2
```

#### Setup Flutter

Next, we need to set up the Flutter environment. We use the `subosito/flutter-action` action to specify the Flutter version that we want to use, which in this case is `3.10.6`.

```
    - name: Setup Flutter
        uses: subosito/flutter-action@v2
        with:
            flutter-version: "3.10.6"
```

#### Install Dependencies

Before building the APK, we need to install the necessary dependencies. This is done using the `flutter pub get` command, which fetches all the dependencies listed in your project's `pubspec.yaml` file.

```
    - name: Install Dependencies
        run: flutter pub get
```

#### Build the APK

With the dependencies installed, we can now build the APK. We use the `flutter build apk --release` command to build a release version of the APK, which is optimized for distribution.

```
    - name: Build APK
        run: flutter build apk --release
```

#### Upload apk to the artifacts

Finally, we archive the built APK using the actions/upload-artifact action. This makes the APK available as an artifact in the GitHub Actions workflow run, allowing you to download it from the GitHub interface.

```
  - name: Archive Artifacts
    uses: actions/upload-artifact@v2
    with:
      name: app-release
      path: build/app/outputs/flutter-apk/app-release.apk
```

Now you can ensure an always ready-to-distribute APK without the need for manual builds!
